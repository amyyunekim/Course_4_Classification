# Course_4_Classification
Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a massive household survey for 11 severely affected districts which covered all buildings in these districts to assess building damage. This project uses building features to predict the level of building damage sustained from Grade 1 to 5. A number of machine learning models were trialled to solve this multiclass problem. The chosen model was a Random Forest Classification model with a F1 micro score of 0.4470. A proof of concept model was deployed in Streamlit.
